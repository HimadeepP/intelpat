Vendor releases patches:
RedHat → RHSA (Red Hat Security Advisory)
Ubuntu → USN (Ubuntu Security Notices)

Cybersecurity team scans CVEs.
They create Patch Bulletin / Patch Advisory and share with Infra team.

CVE-2023-XYZ affecting OpenSSL
Servers impacted: 312 Linux servers.

✅ 2. Impact Analysis by Linux Team

Which servers are impacted
Which applications running on those servers
Any dependency or risk
Kernel update required or not
Potential downtime required or not
Need reboot or not

tools used
===========
Satellite Server (RedHat)

✅ 3. Approval Process (CAB – Change Advisory Board)


No patching happens without a Change Request (CR).
Linux team raises:
Normal CR → If planned monthly patching
Emergency CR → For critical zero-day vulnerability

CAB checks:
Downtime approval from Application owners
Business impact
Rollback plan
Validation plan

Once approved → change moves to Scheduled state.

✅ 4. Pre-Patching Preparation

✔ Health checks
	uptime  
	df -h  
	free -m  
	top  
	systemctl status <services>
✔ Backup / Snapshot
	VMware snapshot / Hyper-V checkpoint
	Database backup
	Config backup (/etc/) using tar
✔ Application team approval
App should be in maintenance mode or removed from load balancer.

✔ OS lock removal
Make sure no package process running: using ps -aux

✅ 5. Patching Execution (Mostly Automated)
Patching is done by enterprise automation tools:
Ansible Tower / AWX
RedHat Satellite
Jenkins pipelines (in DevOps teams)

How patching is done:
Servers divided into batches → Batch1, Batch2, Batch3
Patching jobs are scheduled automatically
Each job applies:
	OS security patches
	Library updates
	Kernel updates (if required)

Example (RHEL Satellite):
	Satellite pushes repository updates to clients
	Clients run scheduled update jobs (night window)
	Satellite reports compliance % after patching
✅ 6. Reboot Management (If Kernel Updated)
Reboot is the most sensitive part.
✅ 7. Post-Patching Validation
Services running
No errors in logs
No high CPU or memory
FS mounted
Application team validates:
	API response
	DB connection
	Functional checks
✅ 8. Vulnerability Re-scan
Qualys
Nessus
✅ 9. Documentation & Change Closure
Linux team updates:
Before and after screenshots
Patch reports
Validation results
CAB closes the ticket.



“If a system has a kernel panic, I first boot into rescue or recovery mode via GRUB, check kernel and system logs (dmesg, journalctl -k), verify and repair the filesystem (fsck), reinstall or rollback the kernel if corrupted, check hardware if needed, update GRUB, and then reboot into a stable kernel. I also ensure backups and multiple kernels to prevent recurrence.”
